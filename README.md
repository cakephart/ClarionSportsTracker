CIS411 Project 

Capstone project from what used to be Clarion University which is now Pennwest University.

Allowed the university Athletic Events Coordinator to keep track of his students punching in and out of events. 

Students can view hours worked, when they need to work, and the Admin (client) can manage the users how he sees fit!

Publicly available code if anyone wants to see my team's website we made. 

Official or not, this is local code anyone can gander at to see what me and the team worked with and utilized!

Could not have done it without our professor either :)
